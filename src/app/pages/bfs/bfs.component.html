        <p>
            Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a
            given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to
            the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes
            that were encountered but not yet explored.
        </p>

        <p>
            Breadth-first search can be generalized to graphs, when the start node (sometimes referred to as a 'search
            key') is explicitly given, and precautions are taken against following a vertex twice.
        </p>

        <p>
            BFS and its application in finding connected components of graphs were invented in 1945 by Konrad Zuse, in
            his (rejected) Ph.D. thesis on the Plankalk√ºl programming language, but this was not published until 1972.
            It was reinvented in 1959 by Edward F. Moore, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze, and later
            developed by C. Y. Lee into a wire routing algorithm (published 1961).
